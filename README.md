## General Information
Model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. 
It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. 
They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. 
Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
- Top 3 contributors which impact the demand of sahred bikes are:
  -	Feeling temperature in Celsius
  -	Light snow rain – having negative correlation. Decrease in demand in case of light snow and rain
  -	Year – strategies used in 2019 shows a positive response over 2018 count. Hence this is also a key feature.
